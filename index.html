      <p>Avengers End Game is coming to the cinema,but if you want to have a movie marathon and recap the stories of other Marvel movies, this guideline is for you! I made this website as a guideline on how to watch the Marvel Cinematic Universe according to the correct timeline.This timeline is based on the chronological event that happened on the MCU not on the release date.</p>

      <!-- Text source from https://www.technobuffalo.com/avengers-endgame -->
      <p>The MCU began all the way back in 2008, so you may have forgotten what's happened up until now. All you really need to know is that Thanos successfully wiped out half the universe after collecting all six Infinity Stones. He said he did it for the good of all life, as a way to ensure prosperity across the universe.</p>

            <h3>Captain America: First Avenger</h3>
            <p>Release Year: 2011</p>
            <p>Captain America is the fifth Marvel Studios film, with Iron Man, The Hulk, and Thor all having films before Cap. But it's the first film in our list, because the events take place first - during World War II. We see the creation of the super soldier portrayed by Chris Evans, as well as his first battle with Hydra and its leader Red Skull. The film also introduces the Tesseract, a key object in the MCU.</p>

            <p>Release Year: 2019</p>
            <p>The second film on our list is the most recent Marvel Studios film to hit theaters. Captain Marvel is set in 1995. We see the titular hero Carol Danvers, played by Brie Larson, fall to Earth and begin a hunt for the shape-shifting Skrull aliens. There’s as much action here as there is nostalgia, especially if you're a 90s kid, thanks to scenes with Blockbuster stores and even dial-up internet.</p>

It's all about genius/inventor/philanthropist/playboy Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr. He is captured by a terrorist organization, the leader of which wants the latest weapons system designed by Stark. However, Stark designs something even more powerful to help himself escape: The first Iron Man suit.</p>

The government wants the technology behind his suit, and when Stark refuses to hand it over, another weapons manufacturer shows he’s willing to do anything to get his hands on it. This film also introduces fellow Avengers the Black Widow and War Machine.</p>

With all the main heroes having been introduced, the real challenge was finding something daunting enough to force them to work together. The combined power of Loki, the Tesseract, and an alien horde invading New York City proved to be the match that made these superheroes become friends in life and on the frontline.</p>
